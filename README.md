|Ruby|5|5|2|
|CLisp|1|3|5|
|Clojure|2|2|4|

Well, in this way, you can tell the advantage of Cabbagelang clearly.  
Also, here's some reasons that Lisp-like languages are useful.

> Lisp is used for AI because it supports the implementation of software that computes with symbols very well.  
From [AI with LISP](http://www.intelligency.org/ai_lisp.php)

> I do recognize, learning Scheme/Lisp/Racket is a wee bit harder than learning Python (but a lot easier than learning Java/JavaScript). You will, however, be a much better programmer if you do and you will come to appreciate the beauty of these languages such that nothing else will suffice.  
From [Why I Still 'Lisp' (and You Should Too) ](https://betterprogramming.pub/why-i-still-lisp-and-you-should-too-18a2ae36bd8)

These shows that Lisp-like language is good and useful.
Meanwhile, you can tell Cabbagelang is one of the best Lisp-like languages according to the statistical data.
